# Student Ruby Assessment

## Instructions
- Create a file with "\<yourName\>_assessment.rb". 

### Sections 1-6
- Title each section with a comment that includes the name and number of each section. 
- Then write the ruby that fulfills each lettered instruction under the title. There is no need to structure your code based on the lettered instructions.
- If you need to use code from a previous *numbered* section please cut and paste into the approrpriate section.

*tl;dr:* Your deliverable should be structured based on the numbered sections, not the lettered sections.

### Section 7
- Please use the letters and answer each lettered question individually.

### EXAMPLE:
*NB. this is in javascript so if you copy it, you will not be correct.*
```javascript
 //AshleyWilliams_assessment.js
 //1. Arrays
 var my_array = ["Blake","Ashley","Jeff"];
 my_array.push("Avi");
 for(var i=0; i<my_array.length; i++){
  console.log(my_array[i]);   
 }
 console.log(my_array[1]);
 var index = my_array.indexOf("Jeff");
 
 //2. Hashes
 instructor = {"name": "Ashley", "age": 27};
 for(i in instructor){
  console.log(i + ": " + instructor[i]);
 }
 //.... etc etc
 
 //...
 //7. Self
 // a. Arrararrr Syntax error cuz i'm taking this is JS and not ruby
 //.... etc etc
```
 


## Questions

Questions should be answered with the simplest, most barebone solution possible.

###1. Arrays

  `array = ["Blake","Ashley","Jeff"]`

  a. Add a element to an array

  b. Write a statement to print out all the elements of the array.

  c. Return the value at index 1.

  d. Return the index for the value "Jeff".

###2. Hashes

  `instructor = {:name=>"Ashley", :age=27}`

  a. Add a new key for location and give it the value "NYC".
  
  b. Write a statement to print out all the key/value pairs in the hash

  c. Return the name value from the hash.

  d. Return the key name for the value 27.

###3. Nested Structures

  ```ruby
school = { 
  :name => "Happy Funtime School",
  :location => "NYC",
  :instructors => [ 
    {:name=>"Blake", :subject=>"being awesome" },
    {:name=>"Ashley", :subject=>"being better than blake"},
    {:name=>"Jeff", :subject=>"karaoke"}
  ],
  :students => [ 
    {:name => "Marissa", :grade => "B"},
    {:name=>"Billy", :grade => "F"},
    {:name => "Frank", :grade => "A"},
    {:name => "Sophie", :grade => "C"}
  ]
}
  ```

  a. Add a key to the school hash called "founded_in" and set it to the value 2013. 

  b. Add a student to the school's students' array.

  c. Remove "Billy" from the students' array.

  d. Add a key to every student in the students array called "semester" and assign it the value "Summer".

  e. Change Ashley's subject to "being almost better than Blake"

  f. Change Frank's grade from "A" to "F".

  g. Return the name of the student with a "B".

  h. Return the subject of the instructor "Jeff".

  i. Write a statement to print out all the values in the school. ***FLAG

###4. Methods

  Note: You will need to pass the school variable to each of these methods to include it in scope.

  a.  
   i. Create a method to return the grade of a student, given that student's name.
   ii. Then use it to refactor your work in 3.i. 

  b. 
   i.Create a method to udpate a instructor's subject given the instructor and the new subject.
   ii. Then use it to update Blake's subject to "being terrible".

  c. 
   i. Create a method to add a new student to the schools student array.
   ii. Then use it to add yourself to the school students array.

  d. 
   i. Create a method that adds a new key at the top level of the school hash, given a key and a value. 
   ii. Then use it to add a "Ranking" key with the value 1.

###5. Object Orientation

  a. Create a bare bones class definition for a School class.

  b. Define an initialize method for the School class.

   i. Give your School class the instance variables: name, location, ranking, students, instructors.
   NOTE: These variables should be of the same type as they are in the hash above.

   ii. Rewrite your initialize method definition to take a parameter for each instance variable. 

   iii. Initialize each instance variable with the value of the corresponding parameter.

  c. Create an attr_accessor for name, location, instructors, and students. Create an attr_reader for ranking.

  d. Create a method to set ranking, given a ranking value.

  e. Create a method to add a student to the school, given a name, a grade, and a semester.

  f. Create a method to remove a student from the school, given a name.

  g. Create an array constant SCHOOLS that stores all instances of your School class.

  h. Create a class method `reset` that will empty the SCHOOLS constant.

###6. Classes

  a. Create a Student class.

  b. Refactor your School instance methods to treat Students as an array of objects instead of an array of hashes.

  c. Create a method in the School class that finds a student by name and returns the correct Student object. 

###7. Self

  For this section, please use the letters and answer each individually.

  Note: in cases where self is an instance of an object just note that as the object id printed to the screen is going to be different everytime

  a.What should this Class print to the screen when defined/loaded?

  ```ruby
  class Student

    def self.say_hello
      puts "hello"
    end

    say_hello
    puts self

  end
  ```

  b. What should this Class print to the screen when defined/loaded?

  ```ruby
  class Student

    def self.say_hello
      puts self
    end

    say_hello

  end
  ```

  c. What should this Class print to the screen when defined/loaded?

  ```ruby
  class Student

    def initialize
      puts self
    end

    new

  end
  ```

  d. What should this code print to the screen when run?

  ```ruby
  class Student

    def say_hello
      puts self
    end

  end
  ```

  Student.new.say_hello

  e. What should this code print to the screen when run?

  ```ruby
  class Student

    def say_hello
      puts say_goodbye
    end

    def say_goodbye
      "goodbye"
    end

  end
  ```

  Student.new.say_hello
